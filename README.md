**Goal:** To help and enable the distributors for better and efficient management of stores and their employers and to manage the inventory of those stores. The employers will also be able to clock in their respective hours and can have a better and more transparent system.

 • As an employee I want to check the number of hours that I have worked any particular week.
 • As an store supervisor I want to view all the stores under my supervision. 
 • As an admin I want to edit the stores that are under my supervision in case they have to be moved elsewhere
 • As an admin I want to be able to remove the stores that are no longer under the organisation.
 • As an employee I want to know the exact wages that I am due for any particular period of time that I have worked.


All the code is done equally by all the team members but it was uploaded by Kausthuba Vanam.

**Based on the quality attributes such as Performance, Availability, Reliability, Scalability and Elasticity the architectural design style we have chosen is MVC. MVC architecture has high cohesion and low coupling.**

**MVC is an architectural pattern consisting of three parts: Model, View, Controller.
Model: Handles data logic.
View: It displays the information from the model to the user.
Controller: It controls the data flow into a model object and updates the view whenever data changes.
