Quality Attributes of a software system 
determine how the system performs. They 
define how well should a system perform any 
particular action and also determine the 
externally visible properties of a system. 
They might seem subtle but they are as 
important as the functional requirements of the  software system.

The non functional requirements of the software system given in the problem statement is as given below.

Reliability- Users should be able to access the 
application at almost all times since there are employees working almost everytime and stores can be added at any time an employee 

Scalability- The software must be able to scale to accomodate more stores and more employees. 


Availability- The Staff as well as the admin must be able to use the software at all times possible.

Maintainability- If the distribution system software goes down it should be brought back up as soon as possible so that features like attendance management can be used.

Manageability- When updating the order status and the store status the entire application should be up to use the other features.

Recoverability- If any major mishap happens 
on the system it should be up and running in 
within a day at the most.

Interoperability- The web application must be 
using layered architecture.

Data Integrity- The software must maintain 
data integrity by keeping backups of all 
updates to the database for every record 
transaction.

Capacity- The software must be able to 
accommodate at least as many users as there 
are employees and also as many as stores that are under their supervision 

Usability- The web application must be easy to 
use and navigate for all the users
